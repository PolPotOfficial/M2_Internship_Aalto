In this folder you will see four R script files.

They show how I use R5r to compute the travel matrix, based on the OD pairs that I got.

The reason I jumped to R from Python in this part is because R5py cannot deliver me correct results -- I can only receive the matrices for mode WALK.

The outputs are the files in folder "Data_OD Matrix".
