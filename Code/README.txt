This is to record part of the codes that I wrote and edited for my M2 internship at Aalto University, from 2025-04-07 to 2025-10-10.

This internship is supervised by Prof. Henrikki Tenkanen and Dr. Subhrasankha Dey, at GIST Lab, Aalto University.

The title for my internship project is "Mapping Dynamic Public Transportation Carbon Emissions at Helsinki".

Some of the comments or codes may contain a little bit of Chinese. Generally they do not affect the final result, but do take care about the potential reading errors for Chinese characteristics on your laptop.
