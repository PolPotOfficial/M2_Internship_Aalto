In this folder you will see one Jupyter Notebook file.

It shows how I compute CO2 emission based on the OD matrices, using LCA carbon emission data.

Please use the file in folder "Data_OD Matrix" to compute the code.

Note: After computing you will have several temporary GPKG files. Please DO NOT delete them.
